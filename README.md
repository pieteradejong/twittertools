# twittertools
**fun and useful tools for a product i love**

## TODO list:
* fetch all my own tweets with either zero likes, zero replies, or zero RTs


##This project will:
- show who is not following me back
- show who I am not following back

- attempt to group tweeps I follow into lists that make sense
- attempt to classify and storify my favorites in ways that make sense

## Further ideas:
- when viewing another user's profile, recommend which if any of your lists that user would be a good fit for

## Some definitions:
- Friends = who am I following
- Followers = who is following me

## Other features:
- reply ranking
- for user: ratio replies/original
- for user: how often replies to replies?
- given tweet, find all instances of quoted tweet


- brief into qustionairre to get you started
