To run the backend server separately:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --reload
```

To use the CLI interface:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python -m src.main --number 10  # Fetch 10 recent likes
```

To download Twitter data:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python scripts/download_x_data.py  # Downloads tweets, likes, and bookmarks
```

To use the comprehensive X API CLI:
```bash
source env/bin/activate
python scripts/comprehensive_data_fetcher.py stats  # Get comprehensive statistics
python scripts/comprehensive_data_fetcher.py user --user-id 123456789 --data-types tweets likes
```

> **Note:** Always run the CLI as a module (with `-m src.main`) from the project root to ensure imports work for both CLI and API modes.

### Frontend Development

#### Technology Stack
The frontend is built with modern React technologies:
* **React 18** with TypeScript for type safety
* **Vite** for fast development and optimized builds
* **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
* **Headless UI** for accessible, unstyled interactive components
* **React Query (TanStack Query)** for data fetching and state management

> **Note:** The UI was migrated from Mantine to Tailwind CSS + Headless UI. All new UI should use Tailwind CSS and Headless UI only.

#### Component Architecture
The frontend follows a clean, domain-driven architecture for better maintainability:

```

## Contributing

This project provides a complete platform for X (Twitter) data analysis with comprehensive API coverage, intelligent caching, and flexible access patterns. Contributions are welcome!

## Credential Authentication Cache

To minimize unnecessary API calls, this project caches the validity of Twitter credentials (for both user-level and app-level authentication) using SHA-256 hashes. No secrets are ever stored—only a hash of the credentials and the authentication status (success/failure) are saved locally. This means:

- If you use the same credentials, the system will remember they worked and skip redundant authentication API calls.
- The cache is stored in `data/auth_cache.json`.
- TTL is infinite: once a credential is validated, it is trusted until you change credentials.
- This improves speed and reduces rate limit risk during development.

**Security:** Only hashes are stored, never the actual credentials.

## Logging System

The application uses a comprehensive logging system with the following features:

- Colored console output for better visibility
- Different colors for different types of messages:
  - Auth messages (Cyan)
  - Fetch operations (Magenta)
  - Data processing (Green)
  - Rate limits (Yellow)
  - Errors (Red)
- Emoji indicators for quick status recognition
- Separate file logging (plain text) for parsing
- Detailed progress tracking
- Rate limit monitoring
- Error tracking with full context

Logs are stored in `logs/download.log` and can be used for debugging or monitoring the application's behavior.

## Local Twitter Archive Data Files

The application now uses local data files from your Twitter archive (located in `twitter-archive-2025-05-31/data/`) as the primary data source. Below are the most relevant files and their purposes:

- `tweets.js`: All tweets posted by the account, including text, metadata, and references to media.
- `like.js`: All tweets liked by the account.
- `block.js`: Accounts blocked by the user.
- `mute.js`: Accounts muted by the user.
- `lists-created.js`: Lists created by the user.
- `lists-member.js`: Lists the user is a member of.
- `lists-subscribed.js`: Lists the user is subscribed to.
- `follower.js`: Accounts following the user.
- `following.js`: Accounts the user is following.
- `direct-messages.js`: One-on-one direct messages.
- `direct-messages-group.js`: Group direct messages.
- `deleted-tweets.js`: Tweets deleted by the user.
- `profile.js`: Profile information (bio, avatar, etc.).
- `account.js`: Account-level information (email, username, creation date, etc.).
- `tweet-headers.js`: Metadata for tweets.
- `tweetdeck.js`: TweetDeck-related data.
- `moments_media/`, `tweets_media/`, `profile_media/`, etc.: Folders containing images, videos, and GIFs shared in tweets, DMs, or as profile media.

For a full list and detailed descriptions, see the `twitter-archive-2025-05-31/data/README.txt` file in your archive.

## Resetting and Reloading the Database

If you need to reset your local SQLite database (for example, after updating your Twitter archive or to fix schema issues), follow these steps:

1. **Reset the database:**
   This will delete the existing database and recreate an empty one with all required tables.
   ```bash
   ./data/reset_db.sh
   ```

2. **Reload your data from the Twitter archive:**
   This will repopulate the database with all your archive data.
   ```bash
   python scripts/load_local_data.py
   ```

This is the recommended way to ensure your database is in sync with your latest Twitter archive. You can safely run these scripts any time you want to start fresh.

## Semantic Tweet Classification

The application includes advanced semantic classification capabilities that allow you to filter and search your Twitter likes by topic using modern NLP techniques.

### Features
* **Zero-shot classification** - No training data required
* **Multi-label support** - Tweets can belong to multiple topics
* **Configurable similarity thresholds** - Adjust sensitivity
* **Real-time semantic search** - Natural language queries
* **Extensible topic system** - Easy to add new topics

### Default Topics
The system comes with three pre-configured topics:
* **Technology** - AI, programming, software development, tech news
* **Politics** - Political discussions, policy, elections, governance
* **Miami** - Local Miami content, events, culture, news

### How It Works
1. **Sentence Transformers**: Uses the `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` model for text embeddings
2. **Cosine Similarity**: Compares tweet content to topic seed phrases
3. **Threshold-based Classification**: Configurable similarity threshold (default: 0.3)
4. **Batch Processing**: Efficient classification of large datasets

### Usage
* **Frontend**: Use the "Semantic Likes" section to filter by topic or search semantically
* **API**: Access classification endpoints programmatically
* **Background Processing**: Trigger classification of all likes via API

### Performance
* Model loading: ~2-3 seconds (cached after first use)
* Classification: ~0.6 seconds per tweet
* Database storage: Efficient indexing for fast retrieval

### Adding New Topics
Topics are defined in `src/semantic_classifier.py` with seed phrases that represent the topic's semantic space. The system automatically handles multi-label classification and similarity scoring.

[DEPRECATED] ~~## Functional requirements~~

* show who is not following me back
* show who I am not following back
* attempt to group tweeps I follow into lists that make sense
* attempt to classify and storify my favorites in ways that make sense
* when viewing another user's profile, recommend which if any of your lists that user would be a good fit for
* reply ranking
* for user: ratio replies/original
* for user: how often replies to replies?
* given tweet, find all instances of quoted tweet
* brief into qustionairre to get you started
