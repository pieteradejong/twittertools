**fun and useful tools for a product i love**

##This project will:
- show who is not following me back
- show who I am not following back

- attempt to group tweeps I follow into lists that make sense
- attempt to classify and storify my favorites in ways that make sense

## Further ideas:
- when viewing another user's profile, recommend which if any of your lists that user would be a good fit for

## Some definitions:
- Friends = who am I following
- Followers = who is following me
