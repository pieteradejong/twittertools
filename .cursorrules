# Cursor Project Rules for twittertools

Project goal: side project that fetches all of my twitter activity, e.g.tweets, replies etc.
and then react vite frond end that allows me to perform certain actions e.g. delete tweets




- Never store Twitter API secrets or tokens in plaintext or logs.
- When caching authentication status, always use a secure hash (e.g., SHA-256) of credentials, never the secrets themselves.
- TTL for authentication cache is infinite (no expiration) unless otherwise specified.
- Prefer local caching (SQLite, JSON, etc.) for all Twitter data to minimize API calls.
- Document all caching strategies and security considerations in the README.
- Keep code modular: separate caching, API, and business logic.
- Always prioritize user security and privacy.
- If in doubt, ask for explicit user consent before storing any new type of data.
- All new features should include a note in the README if they affect data storage or caching.
- All new frontend UI must use Tailwind CSS and Headless UI (not Mantine).
- The migration from Mantine to Tailwind CSS + Headless UI is complete.
